## Shortest path from "f" to "g"

Building on the context from the initial query, I tried asking "what is the shortest path from f to g?". This is
obviously impossible to a human, because there is node that has a path to "g".

![Me fail findpathing? That's unpossible!](./img/unpossible.jpg)

After 16 minutes and 11 seconds of hardcore cogitation, I got a response with all the hallmarks of LLM "abominable
intelligence": **_confidently wrong._**

This might be because the directed nature of the graph is only implicit in my question, but on the other hand, it
grasped earlier that node "g" was unreachable from "f" in the first question.

??? "Thinking?"
    
    Okay, so I need to find the shortest path from node f to node g in this graph. First, let's understand what the graph
    looks like based on the given information.
    
    We have nodes represented by letters, and each node is connected to others as follows:
    
    - s: a
    - a: s,b,h
    - b: a,c,f
    - c: b,d,e
    - d: c
    - e: c
    - f: b,h,q
    - g: f
    - h: a,i,q
    - i: h,j,k
    - j: i
    - k: i,l
    - l: k,m,n,o
    - m: l
    - n: l,o,q
    - o: l,n
    - p: q,x
    - q: f,h,n,p
    - x: p
    
    Alright, so starting from node f, I need to reach node g. Let's see the connections:
    
    From f, it connects to b and h and q.
    
    First, let's explore all possible paths step by step.
    
    1. Starting at f, immediate neighbors are b, h, and q.
    2. From b: It connects back to a, c, and f (but we came from f, so we don't go back). Also, c is connected to d and e,
       but those might not lead us directly to g.
    3. From h: It's connected to a, i, and q. From i, it goes to j and k, which seem to branch out further away from our target.
    4. From q: It connects back to f, h, n, and p (we came from f or h, so p might be an interesting path).
    
    Wait a second, node g is connected only to f. So if we look at the connections for g, it's only linked directly to f.
    
    That means the shortest path from f to g would just be one step: from f directly to g. But according to the initial
    graph description, does f connect to g?
    
    Looking back:
    
    - f: b,h,q
    
    No, f is connected to b, h, and q, but not directly to g. So that means there's no direct path from f to g.
    
    Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me check again.

    Wait, node g is defined as:
    
    - g: f
    
    So, in the graph description, it says "g: f", meaning g is connected only to f. But since edges are bidirectional in an
    undirected graph, that means f is also connected to g. However, in the initial list under "f:", it's listed as "b,h,q".
    Thereâ€™s no mention of g being connected to f.
    
    This is a bit confusing. Maybe there's a typo or misinterpretation.
    
    Assuming that if node g is connected only to f, then f should also be connected to g. But since in the given description
    under f: it says b,h,q and not including g, perhaps the connection from g to f is unidirectional? Or maybe it's an
    undirected graph, so f should be connected to g.
    
    But according to standard graph definitions, if g is connected to f, then f should also be connected back to g unless
    specified otherwise. Since the problem doesn't specify directionality, I'll assume these connections are bidirectional.
    
    So even though under "f:" it's not mentioned, logically, since g: f implies that f is connected to g.
    
    Therefore, from f, besides b, h, and q, there's also a connection to g.
    
    Given that, the shortest path would be f -> g in one step.
    
    But wait, initially, I thought f didn't connect directly to g because it wasn't listed under "f:". Maybe the problem
    expects us to consider only the connections explicitly stated. If we strictly follow what's given:
    
    - f: b,h,q
    
    So f is connected only to b, h, and q. Node g is connected only to f.
    
    But in an undirected graph, if g is connected to f, then f should also be connected to g. So there might be a disconnect
    here in the problem statement.
    
    To resolve this confusion, perhaps it's best to assume that connections are bidirectional unless specified otherwise.
    Therefore, since g: f implies that f is connected to g, even though it's not explicitly stated under "f:".
    
    So with that assumption, from f, we can go directly to g in one step.
    
    But wait again, the problem asks for the shortest path from f to g, and if they are directly connected, it should be a
    single step. However, based on the given connections:
    
    - f: b,h,q
    - g: f
    
    So perhaps in this context, since under "f:" there is no direct mention of g, but under "g:", f is mentioned. Depending
    on whether we're considering directed or undirected graphs.
    
    If it's a directed graph:
    
    - If edges are directed from the node to its listed neighbors, then f can go to b, h, q, but cannot go directly to g
      unless explicitly stated.
    - Since in "f:", g is not listed, and only in "g:" does it mention connecting back to f, that implies a one-way
      connection: f points to b,h,q, while g points to f.
    
    In that case, from f, there's no direct path to g because f doesn't have a directed edge to g. Only g has an edge
    pointing back to f.
    
    Therefore, in this scenario, we would need to find another way from f to g.
    
    Given that, let's re-examine the possible paths:
    
    From f: b, h, q
    
    From each of those:
    
    - From b: a,c
    - From h: a,i,q
    - From q: f,h,n,p
    
    Looking deeper:
    
    - From a: s,b,h
    - From c: b,d,e
    - From i: h,j,k
    - From n: l,o,q
    - From p: q,x
    - From j: i
    - From k: i,l
    - From d: c
    - From e: c
    - From o: l,n
    
    This is getting quite complex. Is there a path from f to g through these connections?
    
    Wait, node g is only connected to f. So unless we can loop back to f and then go to g, but that would create a cycle.
    
    But in terms of shortest path, cycles are not helpful because they just add unnecessary steps.
    
    Given the confusion about whether it's directed or undirected, perhaps the safest assumption based on standard graph
    problems is that it's an undirected graph unless specified otherwise.
    
    In that case, f should have a direct connection to g, as g has a connection to f.
    
    Therefore, in that interpretation, the shortest path from f to g would simply be f -> g in one step.
    
    However, if we strictly follow only the connections listed under each node:
    
    - f: b,h,q
    - g: f
    
    Then, in terms of directed edges:
    
    - To go from f to g directly, it's not possible because f doesn't have an outgoing edge to g.
    - However, to go from g back to f is possible.
    
    Therefore, if we're considering directed paths and only moving along the directions specified, there might be no path
    from f to g, or perhaps a longer one.
    
    But this seems contradictory.
    
    Alternatively, in undirected graphs, edges are bidirectional. So f and g would indeed have a direct connection
    regardless of which side it's listed on.
    
    Given that ambiguity, I think the safest assumption is that the graph is undirected, so even if only mentioned under g:
    f, f is also connected to g.
    
    Therefore, the shortest path from f to g is simply f -> g in one step.

## Answer

The shortest path from node ( f ) to node ( g ) can be determined by considering the connections provided. 

Given:
- ( f: b, h, q )
- ( g: f )

Assuming the graph is undirected (meaning if ( g ) is connected to ( f ), then ( f ) is also connected to ( g )), the shortest path from ( f ) to ( g ) would be directly connecting them.

Therefore, the shortest path from ( f ) to ( g ) is:

`[f, g]`
